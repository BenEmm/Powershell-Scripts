# Useful Powershell Scripts

Hello, World!

The goal of this repo is to house the Powershell scripts I've created, adapted, or acquired throughout my days as a SysAdmin/Technician. Ideally, they'll solve problems or automate tedious processes.

I'm still learning Powershell so there won't be anything too crazy in here just yet, but as the years go by I envision this becoming quite a useful place.

## Current Highlights:

- Automation of the leaver process when a user leaves the business.
- Automation of email reports for the entire business.
